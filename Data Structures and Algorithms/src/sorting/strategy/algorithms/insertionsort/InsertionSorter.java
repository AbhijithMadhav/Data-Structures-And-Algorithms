/*
 * 2.1.24 Insertion sort with sentinel. Develop an implementation of
 * insertion sort that eliminates the j>0 test in the inner loop by first
 * putting the smallest item into position. Use SortCompare to evaluate the
 * effectiveness of doing so. Note : It is often possible to avoid an
 * index-out-of-bounds test in this wayâ€”the element that enables the test to
 * be eliminated is known as a sentinel.
 * 
 * 2.1.25 Insertion sort without exchanges. Develop an implementation of
 * insertion sort that moves larger elements to the right one position with
 * one array access per entry, rather than using exch(). Use SortCompare to
 * evaluate the effectiveness of doing so.
